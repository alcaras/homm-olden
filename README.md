# Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era — Datamine

Hero classes, subclasses, and starting loadouts for *HOMM: Olden Era*,
extracted from the game's JSON files and rendered as a small reference site.

**Site**: <https://alcaras.github.io/homm-olden/>

The raw game files (`HeroesOldenEra_Data/`, `catalog/raw/`) are **deliberately
excluded** from this repo — they're copyrighted game data. To regenerate the
JSONs and the site from a fresh checkout, you need a copy of the game.

## Reproducing locally

1. Install the game and locate `HeroesOldenEra_Data/` (Steam: `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Heroes of Might and Magic Olden Era/`).
2. Symlink or copy that folder into the repo root.
3. Extract the game data:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "
   import zipfile, os
   src = 'HeroesOldenEra_Data/StreamingAssets/Core.zip'
   dst = 'catalog/raw'
   os.makedirs(dst, exist_ok=True)
   with zipfile.ZipFile(src) as z:
       for info in z.infolist():
           name = info.filename
           if not info.flag_bits & 0x800:
               try: name = name.encode('cp437').decode('utf-8')
               except Exception: pass
           out = os.path.join(dst, name)
           if name.endswith('/'):
               os.makedirs(out, exist_ok=True); continue
           os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(out), exist_ok=True)
           with z.open(info) as s, open(out, 'wb') as d:
               d.write(s.read())
   "
   ```
4. Build the catalog and docs:
   ```bash
   python3 catalog/scripts/build_catalog.py
   python3 catalog/scripts/build_classes_json.py
   python3 catalog/scripts/build_specializations_json.py
   python3 catalog/scripts/build_docs.py
   # optional analyses
   python3 catalog/scripts/analysis_tier_list.py
   python3 catalog/scripts/analysis_hero_score.py
   python3 catalog/scripts/analysis_magic_coverage.py
   ```
5. Preview the site (requires Ruby + Jekyll):
   ```bash
   cd docs && bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

## Notes

- All hero / unit / skill / subclass display names are pulled from the
  English locale (`raw/Lang/english/texts/*.json`).
- The build is intentionally simple: one tolerant JSON loader + a few
  Python scripts using only the standard library (no extra deps).
- Effects render with `{0}` placeholders preserved — the values are
  computed at runtime from each entity's `bonuses` block. The
  `descriptionArgs` field in `specializations.json` tells you what each
  placeholder maps to.
